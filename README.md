# Site Energy Usage Intensity Prediction

The goal of the project is to predict energy usage intensity of a building in a given year, based on building characteristics and weather data for the location of the building. The dataset contains roughly 100 thousand observations of building energy usage records collected over 7 years, in several states within the United States. It consists of various building characteristics (e.g. floor area, facility type etc), weather data for the corresponding location of the building (e.g. annual average temperature, annual total precipitation etc) as well as the energy usage for the building and the given year, measured as site energy usage intensity (Site EUI). Each row in the data corresponds to a single building observed in a given year.
